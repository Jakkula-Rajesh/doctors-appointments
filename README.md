# NirogGyan Frontend Assignment

## Project Overview
This is a responsive healthcare appointment booking web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to view doctors, check their availability, and book appointments.

## Features
- Landing page listing doctors with search/filter and availability status
- Doctor profile page with detailed info and schedule
- Appointment booking form with confirmation message
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Mock backend using static JSON data

## Tools & Libraries Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Improvements with More Time
- Integrate a real backend using Node.js/Express
- Add authentication for patients
- Implement calendar integration for appointments
- Add notifications (email/SMS)
- Enhance accessibility and add more form validation

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- Ensuring responsive design: Used Tailwind CSS utility classes and tested on multiple screen sizes.
- Managing state: Used React Context API for global state and hooks for local state.
- Mocking backend: Created static JSON files to simulate API responses for doctors and appointments.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
